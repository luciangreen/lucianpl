lucianpl :-

% convert ssi to c x too big, can't change it easily x too slow - use caw (with higher order programming), pf, static, dynamic analysis tools to check it

% do automated algs not convert ssi to c
% individually convert ssi to lp with converter, because equals4 is one of preds
% and'ed statements -> if thens simpler with cli
% x better performance if converted directly into c x easier to program the multi-layered alg
